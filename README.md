# ADBeasyInfo
This tool was created with the intention of pulling the IMEI, Serial Number, and MAC Address off of Android phones. 
This information is then exported to either a local file or the predefined server sheet.

The ability to install APK's to the phones was added in order to easily install controlled versions of software to devices.

Written in Visual Basic and using ADB to communicate with devices.

It is important to have a copy of ADB in order for this tool to work. 
There is a button labeled "Fix ADB Location". This opens a file browser that lets you point to where the ADB directory is.
